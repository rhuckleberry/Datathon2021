We focussed first on exploring the data to find any interesting patterns. 
We visualized the data by plotting and looked at statistics with Pandas 
statistics functions. Data selection including dropping many features that 
did not seem useful such as state since all of the data was in the state of 
Texas. Feature generation was another important part of our preprocessing 
stage. We create columns such as the day of the week and the season. 
For modeling, we used a number of different models including naive bayes, 
random forests, linear regression, and densely connected neural networks. 
The best model was by far the random forest model which we believe worked 
well with the categorical nature of the data. After tuning the model we also
 conducted a feature importance analysis to determine the most important 
features. In the end we used a 7030 train-test split which where the 30 percent
 was basically our validation set. The testing set in this case would be the 
scoring data provided by Chevron. On our validation score we had a 9.67 on our 
validation RMSE score. However, after running scoring we received a surprisingly 
better 3.87 RMSE score.
